I think my best approach is to try to work recursively so that each time I find the next longest sequence, I know to only add one step - if I do that, I think I have to work from the back... not sure. |
| Jan 14 | 5:45-6:15pm  | I was struggling to find a way to actually open up my project on IntelliJ (It was pushed to my GitHub but I couldn’t find it on my IntelliJ projects), so I’m going to get help on how to actually open it during tutorial tomorrow. In the meantime, I still wanted to clarify my idea and get some thoughts out, so I started brainstorming on a whiteboard. Basically, my idea is to call a recursive algorithm that will include some sort of start (and end?) index of the array to search, as well as a tracker for the length of a given run. From there, it will traverse and find the longest instance of increasing numbers - the recursive call would change the next index to look at (I think it should look for any future numbers that increase from my “current” end index), and over time, the problem and time would be deduced, as we’re finding the largest span of increasing days from a subarray of the array, and then you know just to add one to the count for the next step you take (the next day you look at / choose to include). I’m also trying to think about possibly implementing other data structures that could be helpful (ex. using a map to record the longest run of increasing temperatures from a given index or using some data structure to track my recursive array traversal). Lots of ideas but this is the gist of it. |

Instead of traversing through the array backwards, we're traversing forward and finding the longest span bit by bit, and continuing to add 1 to a given temperature's streak since we know it's one step more than the longest run. It also utilizes a map to track the longest days, per my original idea. I'm trying to think of how my solution could be quicker (right now it's O(n^2), and it uses both a nested for-loop and an additional for-loop). |
